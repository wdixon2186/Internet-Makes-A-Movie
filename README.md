**About**
Explains the sites plan.

**Misc**
This site also has user authentication, CRUD capability, and file upload/download ability.

## Installation

it is hosted <a href="https://internet-makes-a-movie.herokuapp.com/">here.</a> Or the user can clone down the repository, install dependencies and run it on their own server.

## Thought Process

This project started out as an idea and then I began to break down the idea to see what would really be needed. I figured it'd be nice to have a lot of user interaction so I focused on uploading files and trying to build out a purpose.

## Unresolved Problems

The two biggest issues that come to mind is the like functionality not working. It would be nice to allow a user to like a post once and keep tracking the amount given.

And the comment posting taking user back to the home page rather than the detail page.
